# README

Simple site created using React to host my implementation from following [React code challenges](https://blog.imocha.io/react-coding-challenges)

Requirements for the app are:

- Home page with links as cards to the different code [challenges](https://blog.imocha.io/react-coding-challenges)
- When click on each card, I should be redirected to its own sub-route
- Use typescript
- Storage code in GitHub
- Site will be hosted in S3
- Site will be deployed using a GitHub action
- Use Amazon Route 53 to buy cheapest domain for the page maybe (check to avoid over billing)
- Use files:

* .env.development.local
* .env.production.local
